# MyReads Project
My Reads is a simple Book Shelf that can be used for organizing your reads. You can use the built-in search to find books and then use one of the three available shelfs (_Currently Reading_, _Want to Read_ and _Read_) to organize them.

## Features
* Three Book Shelfs
* Live Search
* Book's rating
* Book details

You can move books through shelfs using the _down arrow dropdown_: ![Alt Text](http://divisio.d.pr/tNizOS.gif)
